Matlab Simulator for  samplers, quantizers, encoders and filters
1) each of these blocks are implemented in separate  function
2)Your ’Sampler’ function should allow the use of an arbitrary source signal, m(t), and a user-input
sampling frequency fs
3) Your ’Quantizer’ function should have the option that the user chooses between
	a) Uniform mid-rise quantizer, where the user specifies the number of levels, L 	    and the peak  quantization level, mp
	b)Non-Uniform meo -Law quantizer, where the user specifies meo, L and mp
4) Your ’Encoder’ function should allow the user to choose between
	a) Unipolar NRZ signaling
	b)Polar NRZ signaling
	c) Manchester signaling
